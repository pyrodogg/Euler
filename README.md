# Project Euler
This repository contains my experiments and solutions related to the [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) set of mathematical programming challenges.

My two goals for this project are:

1. To exercise my mathematical and logical reasoning skills.
2. To practice implementing algorithms in different programming languages.
